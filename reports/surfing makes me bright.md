## surfing makes me patient
> "Padding, push-up, stand", only one, two, three steps. It seems that surfing 
is same as skiing or skateboarding. If you can stand on the board and get balanced, 
you will be successful!

> At first day, I also think so! I laid on my surfboard with my back to the sea. When
the coach pushed my surfboard and yelled, "Get up!", I pushed up and stand on the board
easily. I thought that was so good.

> Next day, I surfed by myself. When I saw a waving coming, I was padding hard. Sometimes
I could not catch the wave. Sometimes I pushed up early and was even swept down by  
waves. I tried several times until I was exhausted. Finally, I could not raise my arms.
Without the help of my coach, I almost failed every time.

> Now, I am not a rookie. When a wave coming, be patient, padding until keep up with the 
wave. If you failed, be patient, next wave are coming soon!  

I was swept down by the waves.

I love skateboarding, skiing and surfing. I feel exciting when sliding at a 
huge speed.  And I think I am cool when stopping with a pretty curve.

It is easy to start skiing when you find ski trails and skateboarding on any smooth place.   

And I have learned that life is a lot like surfing.
When you get caught in the impact zone,you need to get right back up.
Because you never know what's over the next wave.
And if you have faith,anything is possible.Anything at all.

We often see beginners see a wave after coming, can not catch up with the wave, 
or be shot very embarrassed, this is because if you are out of position or the 
ability to pull water is not enough, the wave will pass through the bottom of 
the board, if you are out of position or pull water hesitate for a moment, the 
wave will take you from the peak to the bottom of the wave;And if you're in a 
good position, you're only going to be able to catch the waves if you're focused 
and trying your best.Chasing waves is like trying to take some chances in life, 
maybe a job, maybe a relationship.Facing the difficulties before the opportunity, 
hesitating or not trying hard enough, the opportunity will slip away from your 
feet, or hit you badly;However, as long as you have the determination to seize 
this opportunity no matter what happens, and do your best, then you are very 
likely to go through these waves of life.
