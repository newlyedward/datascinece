## surfing makes me patient
Good Afternoon! My name is Sherry! My topic is "Surfing Makes Me Patient".

"Paddle, push-up, stand", only three steps. It seems like skiing .
If you stand on the board and get balanced, you are successful!

At first, I thought so! I laid on my surfboard. When coach pushed me and yelled,
"Get up!", I pushed up and stood on the board easily. I thought--easy.

Next day, I surfed by myself. When I saw a wave coming, I was paddling hard. Sometimes
I couldn't catch the wave. Sometimes I pushed up early and was swept down by
waves. I tried, tried, tried ... I couldn't raise my arms. Without the help of my coach,
I failed every time.

Now, I am not a rookie. When a wave come, be patient, paddle until you keep up with the
wave. If you fail, be patient, next wave is coming soon!
