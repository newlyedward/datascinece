Surfing Makes Me Patient
Good Afternoon! My name is Sherry! My topic is "Surfing Makes Me Patient".

"Paddle, push-up, stand", only three steps. Surfing seems easy. You just need to stand on the board and get balanced.

At first, I also thought this way! I lay on my surfboard. When coach pushed me and yelled, "Get up!" I pushed up and stood on the board easily.

Next day, I surfed by myself. When I saw waves coming, I tried to paddle hard, but I couldn't catch the wave. I tried, tried, and tried ... but I just couldn't raise my arms and got swept down by waves.

However, with the help of my coach, I practiced more often, and learned to be patient and wait for the right time to come.

Now, I am no longer a rookie. When a wave come, be patient, paddle until you keep up with the wave. If you fail, be patient, because next wave is coming soon!
